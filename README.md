## Goal of the experiment
Do provide project goal from the PoE document.

## A long section about how to run the code, examples of use, requirements, and similar.
Do provide a bullet-proof description so that a person who never used this code will know how to get started.

```
Specifically, do provide a section with information how to copy the repository.
git clone git@github.com:HumanDevIP/Experiment-repository-template.git
```

Also, state python version, and the compute environment where the code was executed (Ubuntu 22.04.LTS at a local machine, AWS EC2, and similar).

## Data
Do provide a description of how to obtain the necessary data. Specifically, do not store data files larger than 1 MB in the data folder.

## Credentials
Remember to provide all credentials, keys in the .env file only. This file is ignored in .gitignore already.  
The `example.env` file is a placeholder to demonstrate what credential keys are needed and should be pushed into the repository.
